generating btc and eth master accounts:
enter dash Mnemonic into ian bip39-standalone.html
switch to BIP32 tab
use default of m/0/0
cd into the same folder as the .env folder (~/poker/poker.payments)
encrypt the private key by running (note that BTC uses a WIF and ETH uses a private key)
cd to /poker/poker.payments (same folder as .env file)
node ./build/poker.payments/src/EncryptCommandLine.js <private key or WIF>
copy the public key and the private encrypted key into the masterAccount field of the currencyConfig document

//if using keys from iancoleman (not trezor)
//get the xpub from iancoleman page 'BIP32 Extended Public Key' field. (switch to BIP32 tab)
//Ensure 'BIP32 Derivation Path' is equal to 'm' (not m/0) as the account will be derived below (due to aligning with trezor)
//if using xpub from trezor needs to be converted using https://repl.it/@moocowmoo/bip32-convert-drkp-to-xpub

DASH xpub:
https://repl.it/repls/StarkIdioticSoftwareengineer to convert dash extended public key from drkp to xpub

ETH xpub:
see doc\trezor\index.html for extracting the xpub from trezor

BTC xpub:
can be copied straight from trezor
